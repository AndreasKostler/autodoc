* Autodoc tasks
** Back to level
*** DONE Merge back to master
*** DONE Standalone autodoc working again
*** DONE Command line option for param-file-driven autodoc building
*** TODO Webhook operational
*** TODO Make sure we can standalone autodoc for 1.1 or 1.2 programs
We should probably use recursive invocation?
*** TODO Update autodoc to a 1.2 base
*** Leiningen support
**** TODO develop strategy for working with Leinigen 1.2
No clojure dependency allowed in plugin
***** Option 1: Just port to 1.2 and drop 1.1 support
I don't thinks this works because standalone requires a clojure dependency 
***** Option 2: Make a lighweight plug-in module separate from autodoc itself
***** Option 3: Don't run as a plugin, but support parsing a project.clj file
** Improved HTML presentation
** Improved 1.2 Support
*** TODO Document protocols and figure out how to link their methods back to them
** Bugs
*** TODO Supplementary docs master TOC doesn't work
We need to add the appropriate ../.. stuff to the links on the master TOC
*** TODO Autodoc doesn't work on windows
This appears to be a pathname thing / vs. \
*** TODO Clean up "only used with ant-wrapper" params in params.clj
*** TODO Make the param-dir option in autodoc.clj better integrated with the rest
