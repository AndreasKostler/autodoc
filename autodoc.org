* Autodoc tasks
** Back to level
*** TODO Merge back to master
*** TODO Standalone autodoc working again
*** TODO Webhook operational 
*** Leiningen support
**** TODO develop strategy for working with Leinigen 1.2
No clojure dependency allowed in plugin
***** Option 1: Just port to 1.2 and drop 1.1 support
I don't thinks this works because standalone requires a clojure dependency 
***** Option 2: Make a lighweight plug-in module separate from autodoc itself
***** Option 3: Don't run as a plugin, but support parsing a project.clj file
** Improved HTML presentation
** Improved 1.2 Support
*** TODO Document protocols and figure out how to link their methods back to them
** Bugs
*** TODO Supplementary docs master TOC doesn't work
We need to add the appropriate ../.. stuff to the links on the master TOC
