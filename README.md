Autodoc is a program which generates API documentation in HTML
from Clojure source code. It can be run
as a standalone application or from a build system such as ant or leiningen.

Complete documentation is available at
(http://tomfaulhaber.github.com/autodoc)[http://tomfaulhaber.github.com/autodoc].

Autodoc is used to generate the documentation for
(Clojure)[http://richhickey.github.com/clojure] itself, 
(Clojure-contrib)[http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib], 
and (Incanter)[http://leibke.github.com/incanter].  

I run it on Ubuntu. I expect it would work fine on any Unix, but probably would have 
some glitches on Windows.

Dependencies: ant, ant-optional, enlive, clojure-contrib
