This is the source code for the robot that automatically generates the
API reference wiki for clojure.contrib which lives at
http://rich-hickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/index.html

I run it on Ubuntu. I expect it would work fine on any Unix, but probably would have some glitches on Windows.

Dependencies:
ant, ant-optional, enlive, clojure-contrib

To come: support for arbitrary clojure packages, better doc.
